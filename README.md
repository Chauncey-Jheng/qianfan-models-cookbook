Example code and guides for basic tasks with LLMs Hosted by Qianfan Platform (https://console.bce.baidu.com/qianfan). You'll need a qianfan account and asscociated API key to accomplish all examples. We will provide example files, prompts within a cookbook. You can run all examples by setting the QIANFAN_TOKEN environment variable.
