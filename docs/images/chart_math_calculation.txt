Got it, let\'s see. The question is asking for the average percentage of U.S. adults who feel equally excited and concerned about AI over the three years: 2021, 2022, and 2023. \n\nFirst, I need to find the data for "Equally excited and concerned" in each of those years. Let me look at the chart. The chart has three categories: "More excited than concerned," "Equally excited and concerned," and "More concerned than excited." For each year, there are bars with percentages for these categories.\n\nLooking at "Equally excited and concerned": For 2021, the percentage is 45. For 2022, it\'s 46. For 2023, it\'s 36. \n\nNow, to find the average, I need to add these three percentages together and then divide by the number of years, which is 3. \n\nSo let\'s add them up: 45 (2021) + 46 (2022) + 36 (2023) = 127. \n\nThen divide by 3: 127 / 3 = 42.333... \n\nSince the question probably expects a numerical answer, maybe rounded to the nearest whole number, which would be 42.33, but maybe they just want the exact average, which is 127/3, but that\'s approximately 42.33. Let me check if I got the numbers right. 2021: 45, 2022:46, 2023:36. Yep, that\'s correct. Adding those gives 127. Divided by 3 is 42.333..., so the average is approximately 42.33%. Depending on how they want it, maybe they want it as a fraction, but since it\'s a survey percentage, probably a decimal or whole number. 127 divided by 3 is exactly 42 and 1/3, so maybe 42.33% or 42.3%. But maybe the question expects an integer, so 42? Wait, 127 divided by 3 is 42.333..., which is 42 and 1/3. So the average is approximately 42.3%. But let me make sure I didn\'t mix up the categories. The question specifically says "equally excited and concerned," so that\'s the middle category. Yep, that\'s right. So the average is (45 + 46 + 36)/3 = 127/3 ≈ 42.33. So the answer is approximately 42.3% or 42.33%. Maybe the question expects it rounded to the nearest whole number, so 42%. But let me check again. 45+46 is 91, plus 36 is 127. 127 divided by 3 is 42.333..., so that\'s the average. I think that\'s it.
